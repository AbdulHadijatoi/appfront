## Changes Made

### 1. **Refactored Routes:**
   - Grouped routes for better organization.
   - Corrected route methods for actions such as `delete` and `update`.

### 2. **Storage Link:**
   - Created symbolic links for storing files in the `public` directory instead of the root `public` directory.

### 3. **File Uploads:**
   - Modified file upload logic to save files in the `storage/app/public` directory, improving file management and security.

### 4. **Product Image Validation:**
   - Added validation for product images to ensure only valid file types (JPEG, PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG) are uploaded and that they do not exceed a size of 1MB.

### 5. **Organized Views and Controllers:**
   - Improved code organization for scalability by separating views and controllers based on the application's needs.

### 6. **Separate Admin Routes:**
   - Created a dedicated file for admin routes to ensure better organization and control over admin-related functionalities.

### 7. **Cache for Exchange Rates:**
   - Implemented caching for fetching exchange rates from an external API to improve performance and reduce redundant API calls.

### 8. **Refactored Views:**
   - Refactored views using layouts and reusable components for better maintainability and consistency across pages.

### 9. **Image Optimization:**
   - Integrated **Intervention Image** library to optimize product images automatically if they exceed 1MB in size.

### 10. **Reusable Code with Traits:**
   - Extracted reusable code (like image optimization) into a dedicated trait for better reusability and cleaner code.


#### Automated Testing Setup

### 1. **Testing Configuration**
The tests are configured to use an **in-memory SQLite database** for faster and isolated testing. This ensures that each test starts with a fresh database without affecting your main development database.

To enable this, the following environment variables are set:

```xml
<env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
<env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
```

This configuration ensures that the database is cleared and reset for each test run, without the need for additional configurations like `DatabaseTransactions`.

### 2. **Testing Types**

- **Unit Tests**: These tests focus on isolated components, ensuring that individual methods or functions work correctly. For example, we tested the image optimizer trait to verify if it optimizes images correctly.
  
- **Feature Tests**: These tests simulate real user interactions and ensure that multiple components work together. We have feature tests for product display, exchange rate fetching, and error logging.

### 3. **Unit Testing Image Optimizer**

The **`ImageOptimizer`** trait has been unit-tested to ensure it correctly optimizes images larger than 1MB and saves them to storage. We used the `Intervention\Image` package for image manipulation.

#### Example Test Case for Image Optimization:

```php
#[Test]
public function it_optimizes_image_when_over_1mb()
{
    // Arrange: Create a mock image file larger than 1MB
    $file = $this->createMockUploadedFile();

    // Act: Call the optimizeImage method
    $path = (new ImageOptimizer)->optimizeImage($file, 'images');

    // Assert: Verify that the file is stored and optimized
    $this->assertFileExists($path);
}
```

### 4. **Feature Testing Product Display**

Feature tests were written to ensure that product data is displayed correctly on the frontend and that API calls for exchange rates are handled properly. 

#### Example Test Case for Product Display:

```php
#[Test]
public function it_displays_product_list()
{
    // Arrange: Create some products
    Product::factory()->count(3)->create();

    // Act: Visit the product list page
    $response = $this->get(route('home'));

    // Assert: Ensure the page loads and displays products
    $response->assertStatus(200);
    $response->assertViewHas('products');
}
```

### 7. **Test Database Setup**

We are using an **in-memory SQLite database** to run our tests. This setup provides a clean slate for every test and avoids polluting your real database with test data.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class SomeFeatureTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    public function test_something()
    {
        // Your test logic...
    }
}
```

This makes the testing process faster and more reliable, especially when working with a clean database state for each test run.

### 7. **Dependencies**

- `phpunit`: Used for running the tests.
- `Mockery`: Used for mocking classes like the `Log` facade.
- `Intervention\Image`: Used for image manipulation in the `ImageOptimizer` trait.
  
### 8. **Running Tests**

To run the tests, simply execute the following command:

```bash
php artisan test
```

This will run both the unit and feature tests for your application.

### 9. **Disabling Database Transactions**

Since weâ€™re using the `:memory:` SQLite database for testing, there is no need to use `DatabaseTransactions` in the test classes. SQLite in-memory databases are automatically reset after each test, ensuring data isolation without the need for explicit transactions.

---

### Conclusion

By leveraging automated tests, we ensure that the application functions correctly in various scenarios, including product display, image optimization, and error handling. The in-memory SQLite database provides a fast and isolated testing environment without affecting the main database.

## Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Database Indexing:**
   - Ensure columns frequently queried (e.g., `name`, `price`, `created_at`) are indexed to improve query performance, especially for large datasets.

### 2. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Consider moving complex business logic to service classes or action classes. This keeps controllers focused on request handling, making the code more maintainable and testable.

### 3. **Improving File Validation:**
   - Improve the validation for product images by adding additional checks such as aspect ratio, dimensions, and file size limits. 
   - Example:
     ```php
     'image' => 'nullable|image|mimes:jpeg,png,jpg,gif,svg|max:1024',
     ```

### 4. **Caching and Performance:**
   - Implement different caching strategies such as **cache tags** or **cache locking** to optimize API calls, especially for frequently accessed data like exchange rates.
   - Consider queuing image optimization tasks to improve performance by offloading heavy tasks to background processes.

### 5. **User Authentication & Authorization:**
   - If sensitive data is involved, ensure proper user roles and permissions for routes and actions like product deletion.
   - Implement **two-factor authentication (2FA)** for added security for admin access.

### 6. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Refactor the admin panel UI for better usability, especially for mobile and tablet users.
   - Implement modern UI components, using **Tailwind CSS** or **Vue.js**, to make the interface more dynamic and interactive.

### 7. **Error Pages and Custom Exceptions:**
   - Customize error pages such as 404 and 500 to provide a better user experience when things go wrong.
   - Implement custom exception handling for specific error cases such as product not found or image upload failure.

### 8. **API Improvements:**
   - Implement **API rate limiting** to protect the system from abuse.
   - Use **API Resources** to format responses better, ensuring consistency across the API.
   - Support **pagination** for API responses when fetching large sets of data.
